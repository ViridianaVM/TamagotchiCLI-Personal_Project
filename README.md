# TamagotchiPractice

I created this project with the purpose to practice C# and Object Oriented Programming. 

A Tamagotchi can eat, play and sleep. The user can decide which activity wants to do with the Tamagotchi.

A Tamagotchi needs to have certain amount of calories in order to be able to play and live healthy. The Tamagotchi will let the user know if it is satisfied or needs to eat more.
